    <h2>We're still working on something amazing right now.</h2><br><br>
    <h3>What is ClassCash?</h3><br>
    ClassCash is a class rewards system designed to provide students with rewards for good behavior and teachers the ultimate customization they want with a rewards system.<br><br>
    <h3>Built for stability</h3><br>
    While other rewards systems like Percle struggle with stability and performance as they are built on the unoptimized Glide, ClassCash is designed to deliver unprecedented performance.<br>
    Built on HTML5 and JavaScript on the frontend, and PHP 8 on the backend, ClassCash will never crash or slow down, no matter how many features are implemented.<br><br>
    <h3>Powered by the real stuff</h3><br>
    Unlike Percle, ClassCash is built on a MySQL database with military-grade encryption, unlike Percle that is built on a simple Google Sheets database.<br>
    This allows for more scalability if more features are to come, and ensures maximum data management performance.<br><br>
    <h3>No glitches</h3><br>
    We know you hate glitches and we do as well. At ClassCash, we make sure to test every single feature, even edge cases, before we deploy it.<br>
    Unlike Percle, this ensures that there are no game-changing glitches like negative funds.<br><br>
    <h3>Ultimate customizability</h3><br>
    ClassCash is designed to be as user friendly as possible. This means that we have a whole array of settings you can toggle to foster the class rewards environment you've always wanted.<br>
    Even though most rewards systems make a lot of decisions for the teacher which can be frustrating, ClassCash allows the teacher to make every decision.<br><br><br>
    <h2>ClassCash, your rewards superpower.</h2>
